# Welcome to the OSMART Community ðŸ‘‹

The OSMART (Open-Source Media Application Reference Tools) workshop is a regular exchange involving the development of open-source software for media applications with a series of status updates and roadmaps on relevant projects from relevant organizations.

## HOW WE STARTED
OSMART was kick-started in May 2022 when five organizations that develop and promote open standards for media distribution - the Consumer Technology Association WAVE Project, DASH Industry Forum, the DVB Project, the 5G Media Action Group (5G-MAG) and the HbbTV Association - came together for an online workshop. The key objective was to find synergies for collaboration within the organizations. A new edition in 2023 added MPEG and SVTA.

The result of the second edition is now materialized in the OSMART Community, a common GitHub repository - [OSMART Community Â· GitHub](https://github.com/osmart-community) - which, initially will serve as central point for gathering information and shortcuts to the open-source software projects and a placeholder for further activities and collaboration opportunities between the participants.
