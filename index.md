## HOW WE STARTED
OSMART was kick-started in May 2022 when five organizations that develop and promote open standards for media distribution - the Consumer Technology Association WAVE Project, DASH Industry Forum, the DVB Project, the 5G Media Action Group (5G-MAG) and the HbbTV Association - came together for an online workshop. The key objective was to find synergies for collaboration within the organizations. A new edition in 2023 added MPEG and SVTA.
