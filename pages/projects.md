# DASH-IF
## Joint Content Conformance Project (JCCP)
### SUMMARY
JCCP has developed a conformance tool to validate DASH and HLS content against different guidelines and profiles. There are specs, implementers and users and this tool allows e.g. vendors to check MPDs and segments, they provide test vectors to validate players…
Worth highlighting a big effort in additional details, documentation to make the project more understandable and usable.
